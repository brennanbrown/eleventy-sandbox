# About

Hey there! My name is Brennan, I'm a 24-year-old MÃ©tis web developer and content strategist from Winnipeg, Manitoba and currently reside in Calgary, Alberta. I've recently compeleted a Full Stack Developer Program at [EvolveU](https://www.evolveu.ca/), and I'm looking to help those that need web development work done, or searching for ideas and management for their next content project.

I would also love to volunteer my time to contributing to open-source projects! I love creating and tinkering with small, static websites and projects. I'm a big proponent of putting an emphasis on accessibility and the [A11y project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) in web development.

I'm always looking to work with people that are hopeless idealists like me, as well as who are interested in creating and working on cool, interesting, and meaningful projects! Shoot me [an e-mail](mailto:mail@brennanbrown.ca) if that sounds like your cup of tea.
